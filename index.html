                        Creativity and curiosity are two of my strongest attributes, and I tackle each new challenge
                        with a passion that stems from a love of learning. These attributes have led me into the
                        exciting chapter of my professional career in Web Development, which keeps me learning every
                        day. My background in the hospitality field has cultivated in me the perseverance and grace
                        necessary to thrive in high-paced work environments while always maintaining a strong team
                        spirit. I bring urgency and responsibility to all my projects to bring forward optimal results.
